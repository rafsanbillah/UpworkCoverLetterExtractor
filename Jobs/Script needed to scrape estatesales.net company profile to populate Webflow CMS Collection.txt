Script needed to scrape estatesales.net company profile to populate Webflow CMS Collection

Hi there,

Thank you for your job post regarding a script to scrape estatesales.net company profile to populate Webflow CMS Collection. I understand you want to scrape listings from estatesales.net and copy them to your website. What are the criteria for scraping properties? Do you want a UI for the tool? Where do you want to host the script?

I have took a quick look at estatesales website. It will take 18-20 hours to develop a scraping script for it. Automating the uploading process will not take long. So we are looking at a price point of 500$ to 800$ depending on some factors.

I welcome the opportunity to work on this project for you. May I suggest a call (Zoom or Skype) so that we can discuss the requirements and timeline with you in more detail?

Kind regards,
Rafsan Billah
